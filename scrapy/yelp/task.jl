To make a reservation and still have to wait a long period of time for your table is very upsetting especially if the workers say they enforce the 90 minute limit on every table. The reason why we had to wait was due to a party still dining at the table that was for our reservation.

To make it up to us, the manager apologize to us directly and gave us champagne, and two appetizers on the house. From there, it felt as though Joey really cared about making their customers happy and making up for their mistake. However, I notice that they do not enforce their 90 minute table limit as I saw other customers sitting there for over two hours.

Celebrated one of my bday week dinners here ! I would much rather have a quality authentic pasta in a mom and pup place like this, vs in a glamorous restaurant where they charge arm and leg and you get half of the food in bland taste ... we made reservations online on yelp .

We ordered a salad and a bruschetta for appetizer and a soup . We took our own white wine, for which they gave an ice bucket. Corkage was $20. You actually get to choose your pasta with your sauce . Some sauces are standard , like Alfredo or pesto , \u00a0but some include meat in it or shrimp or fish or chicken . You can choose the sauce already included with the meat , or you can add the meat separately. We ordered: 1)spaghetti with mushroom sauce added filet mignon (both sauce and the filet were to die for ) 2)fettuccine with shrimp and cognac creamy sauce (also amazing) 3)fettuccine with pesto and chicken (also amazing) well 3 of us ate everything in our plates lol and didn't regret it ... for dessert , we ordered pana cota with Nutella, and a tiramisu. I honestly love both of them in general but , tiramisu was a big disappointment. It was dry inside like the cookie was never soaked . Hard. And tasted like artificial flavor . The pana cota was ok , nothing extraordinary. They gave us an extra dessert for my bday on the house, which was nice . We also got 3 decaf espressos. Everything came out to $158 plus tip .

For those that don't know, myself included, if you mention that you are going to the Pantages in your reservation they put a card on your table along with the menu that says you are a Pantages goer and we assumed would give the server a queue that we are on a schedule. Great idea, right? On the other side of the card was an offer of 15% off for Pantages customers. WTH! Score, bonus, winner winner!

I didn't even know about the deal until we saw the card on the table with the menu that she picked up and took away after we ordered. The card is not a small one either. It's almost as big as the main menu and about the same size as the wine menu, with a huge logo of the Pantages on it. Timing wasn't great either as we were celebrating an early birthday and didn't even get to order dessert because it was almost time for the show. Who knows if they offer free dessert for birthdays, because we were right on time and so i guess we'll never know. Anyway, rant over and now I'll get to the food.

My girlfriend had the gnocchi and recommended it. ", "Service: This is where my only problem was. Our waitress was very kind and offered her recommendations but once we started eating, she was no where in sight. Everyone sits relatively close to one another so we could observe other tables receive different treatment than the service we were receiving.

My girlfriend and I, and our couple friends also sat on a couch facing each other. I like the intimate table setting.

While top tier Mexican fare in L.A. often involves transforming dull, discounted meats and CostCo-quality produce, Sonoratown's owners insist on starting with high-quality ingredients that are traditional to the region from which they draw inspiration. Here, the carne asada consists of chunks of salted costilla (beef short rib) rather than the traditionally marinated arrachera (skirt steak). The grill makes a big difference. Here's a secret you already know: most carne asada in southern California would not pass muster in Mexico. Beef grilled on a flat-top in Mexican cuisine is called \"bistec,\" not carne asada. Sonoratown's use of costilla over a blistering hot mesquite-fired grill results in little charred nuggets of beef filled with juices and flavor that you cannot get from arrachera or flank steak alone.

I succinctly needed to describe their tortillas to a friend recently, and I settled on \"the inside of a croissant.\" Flour tortillas are a grotesque joke in the U.S. thanks to mass-production by soulless appropriators. Due southeast, there is a 400-year heritage of making flour tortillas from round-grained winter wheat grown in the Sonoran desert in Mexico. These tortillas are paper-thin yet heavily dosed with lard such that they practically melt in your mouth. Sonoratown's owners buy white wheat flour from a supplier in San Luis Rio Colorado in Mexico to replicate this eating experience.

My entree fell alittle flat for me. The chicken was a bit overcooked. It was extremely dry. When I told our waiter, he allowed me to replace for the cod, (which was my original choice, but I had just had cod a few days prior) The cod was was little bit better. I enjoyed my friend's stuffed peppers. There was alot of flavor packed in those peppers. For dessert we both ordered the chocolate mousse. It took the longest to come out, but it was worth the wait. It was rich and sweet. I couldn't eat it all, but a few bites are satisfying. Our waiter Angel was attentive, made recommendations, and was very personable.
