I'm surprised I've never heard about this place but definitely will be coming back again!", "Catching up on some old draft reviews, this visit was before the pandemic. \u00a0COVID-19 has thrown a wrench into things, so things may be different now, but I wanted to document my visit. ", "I've been a long time fan of this establishment, from the time it first opened on Fig and Adams. As a working (cool) profession, I loved everything about Dirt Dog and went there many times. I often met and spoke with the owner. Over the years, I've grown jealous of all the people that now crowd the restaurant and make it difficult to eat there. As bitter sweet as it may be, I'm still proud of you. I've supported the Las Vegas location (I visited both locations frequently), and I've grown used to the consequences of the hype. However today, was the last straw. I'm high. I'm hungry. It's my day off. I decided to order ahead through GrubHub. I get to the restaurant, just to be informed that \"someone\" had already picked up my order. That's weird, because I'm sure you have to check for validation. I clearly didn't pick up my order. The guy there nonchalantly told me there was nothing he could do with an attitude. Then later, they cancelled the order stating \"an item was sold out.\" Total bullshit. As someone that has been an avid supporter, spreading the word about this place since the beginning of its time, I feel disrespected and disappointed. There was no attempt to rectify it. I'm not one of these out-of-towner, take LA bullshit types of people. As an LA native, I won't deal with the hype. There's no way I should have left feeling disappointed with no food (despite paying ahead). I'd hate to stop going here, but, your employees make it difficult. I'm hungry af, and now I'm mad af. Two combinations that don't lead to a happy Saturday night.", "My mom had been pushing this restaurant recommendation on me for how long, and I'm personally not one to seek out hot dogs. But my mom is trusted foodie, so I tagged along.", "I ordered the green dog and carne asada fries as a late night splurge. I have to say the veggie green dog was the winner. I expected to order both and regret life but the veggie dog was great, as I explained to my bf this was a healthy version of an unhealthy food. The carne asada fries were a bit dry and overcooked to where a lot of water is required to wash them down so I wouldn't recommend those. Overall a good place but order their dogs.", "Best hot dog I've ever tried(dog haus & patty melt)! ", "In LA about to fly home from my honeymoon trip and my husband and I stopped here. Out of the 10 states we went trough and explored this is probably the best food I had in our entire trip. \u00a0It's closely located to LAX and downtown LA and a must stop if you're in the area. \u00a0Hell even if you aren't. Go there. Order ANYTHING. Thank me later. \u00a0Thank you Dirt Dog! The real MVPs.", "Staff are friendly and very welcoming. The food is great, it's different than any other place. \u00a0So many menu choices. The inside is a Los Angeles theme and is as unique as their food. Great place to go.", "This is the epitome of what makes Los Angeles an amazing city for food. I've been wanting to come here for so long and while it was during these challenging times, I was very impressed by the way food gets put out when ordering. Everyone had to stand in a line next to the restaurant while a minimum of ten people could wait or order food inside. After seeing so many short videos of Dirt Dog, my girlfriend and I knew what we wanted. ", "My husband woke up feeling spontaneous one Saturday morning, and suggested we drive an hour into LA to try this amazing hot dog place he'd tried the other day while in LA for work. He must have seen the look of confusion on my face since I'm a vegetarian and wasn't sure why I would find this trip exciting, so he then said \"oh they have vegetarian hot dogs!\" And then I thought - OK, now you're talking! ", "Meh. ", "I tried for the first time with my baby' father this place a year ago and we loved it ", "I REALLY wanted to like this place. But it wasn't that great. I LOVE hot chips and hated the hot cheeto corn. The fried oreos were decent, but I think overpriced for their size. The hot hog was okay, nothing special. The fries were just okay.", "Alexis from Dirt Dog is so helpful, hardworking & informative.", "I learned of their new location in Pasadena. So I stopped by to check it out since I was waiting 30 minutes for a reservation I made for another restaurant. When I came in, everyone was very friendly. The staff was very diverse. I asked to speak with the manager. Her name was Mel. She was extremely kind. I told her about my experience at the LA location and I came by to check the vibe before bringing my minor child back with me due to our experience last year. She warmly reassured us we would be welcomed here!!! I am looking forward to coming back with my son to redo our last experience!! It seems like this location will \u00a0 treat their customers well!!!!", "Very disappointed in Dirt Dog tonight. I purchased close to $35 worth of food and sat at one of their tables waiting on my order. One of the workers walked up to me and accused me of not paying demanding my receipt. I told him the cashier did not give me a receipt. Then he started questioning me \"asking me what did I purchase?\". After going back and forth with him. I told him if he wanted to know what I purchase. He needs to go ask the their cashier because I spent way too much money in here to be harassed!! When he went to ask the cashier and found out I stood in that long line and purchased close to $35 worth of food. he never came back to apologize. This was a very first experience here and because of him it was awful! I was treated very badly. He was very confrontational \u00a0questioning me whether I paid or not. Such a bad evening and I drove there all the way from Pasadena for my son to experience this. Plus we ordered two churros and both of them were cold. I hope they are not single out African Americans because that's exactly what it felt like. We were the only black people there besides the girl sitting next to me, who was there eating with her Caucasian friend. \u00a0Who actually stood up for me and told them I had already paid.", "I've been excited to try this place for a while! I'm glad I did! The patty melt dog was pretty delicious. Also ordered the carne asada fries. Both items tasted great! It was nothing special but DD delivered! ", "This place doesn't serve hotdogs, they serve masterpieces. These have to be the best hotdogs I've ever had. This time around couldn't eat inside of dining area so had to order a head and pick it up. I ordered the Dirty Chili Dog which was fire. Loved the chorizo chili it had on it. I also tried the fried Oreos which were amazing. Will definitely be back again. If you haven't been to Dirt Dog you need to stop by and try this place out.", "What a great 1st time experience for my boyfriend and I. Very welcoming restaurant and not to mention the staff. The food is delicious...literally finger licking good....we will differently be coming back...Thank you Dirt Dog for opening in my city Downey.....", "Best place for esquite!!! I absolutely love corn and this is the place to go except parking is atrocious. I also remember finding a place to sit was also impossible. But that was pre covid.

They wrap the chicken in what looks like a pasta strip that must be to mimic chicken skin. It was ok. Mash potatoes and gravy ok, corn was cold but good, salad had no dressing and way too many g peppers and onions. It just seems like a low budget operation. I definitely applaud the effort to provide vegan alternatives to the world. The steak and eggs breakfast burrito sounds really interesting. Got a strawberry milkshake and maybe I'm spoiled by plant power fast food, because this was like a few scoops of strawberry ice cream in a cup just barely mixed together- like nobody must order the milkshakes and some guy had to hand mash it ahaha, there were lots of strawberries in it though. The guy at the register said my friends order was unnecessarily complicated and had to get the manager which was a little unpleasant. All in all - seems like good to try a couple times but is pretty fattening and oily food - hope to see this plant based business succeed.

The chicken was last and we were sweaty full. \u00a0I had to take it home for lunch tomorrow...it's that good. \u00a0If you don't agree then stop reading my reviews cause you have no taste.", "I went to Soowon again last night and it was FANTASTIC...as usual!!! \u00a0This is the second time that i've been and it was just as good as the first time, if not better. \u00a0This time I stuck with just the beef. \u00a0The pork was good last time, but I had bacon for breakfast and so I decided to stick with the beef. \u00a0The service was awesome. \u00a0They were on top of refills on drinks and panchon. \u00a0The hostess was super nice. \u00a0She seemed a little awkward at first, but after a while she warmed up. \u00a0She was very sweet and hooked me up with a drink while I was waiting for my table. \u00a0The only thing I need to watch when coming here, is my weight!!!", "I've been going to Korean BBQ restaurants all over k town and this place is the best place to go to get authentic, high quality Korean food. \u00a0The service is great and the food even better. I went with a few friends who are kbbq regulars and we all agreed that this is the best place, hands down. The hostess is super cute and really sweet. She got us a table right away and really took care of us. ", "The food was yummy and their outside seating area is really nice. The food is pretty overpriced but it is very good. That said the service really left a lot to be desired. We were ignored for most of our meal and were charged for something that was supposed to be included in the meal.", "WTF!", "One of the best KBBQ I've ever had!", "The quality of the food is amazing however the price is just as amazingly high. Don't go here if you can't afford a $$$ on yelp. ", "Do not expect to receive or treat this establishment like other stereotypical Korean BBQ restaurants. First off, it's not an all-you-can-eat with a cheap price tag attached. You reap what you sow. Therefore in this case, the prices are set high to indulge in better quality meat, service, and all of the above. Like of a social chameleon, they're disinterested in how insufficient their outside environment portrays, the bigger impression is leaving more convinced than when you walked in. ", "Honestly I haven't dined out since before quarantine and this place was great! Couple tables outside and they had a virtual menu which was nice as well. Dividers between tables and they cooked the meat for us. ", "This place is legit delicious. The staff is always helpful. Kind. Cool. Patient.", "Best kbbq spot I've ever been to and I mean this 100%. From my experience, non-AYCE kbbq places tend to have higher quality meats than AYCE places. Every cut of meat was sooo delicious. I absolutely loved the Soowon galbi, which is marinated in their house special marinade. It really is something special!", "Horrible service...they threw us in the back of the outdoor seating...I get it it's rough with this pandemic and getting use to the new norm but it felt like it was racial they kept sending the Hispanic water (because were Hispanic) we sat in front of the portable stove with no meat for 15 minutes at a time. And when the waiter came he couldn't turn it on uuuugh needless to say $200 later NO TIP. We stopped at Burger King to eat after smh. I guess you have to be some sort of Asian or white to be treated like royalty here because if you're not you're still charged top dollar but no service :/ never again.", "Can get pricey but so so delicious - not AYCE. Be prepared to wait but it's worth it. Valet parking is mandatory and convenient as there's no street parking to speak of and the lot is minuscule. Kid-friendly and the servers are attentive and polite.

My best friends\u00a0and I came here on a Sunday night ~ 6:30pm and it was pretty packed already because it only has 4-5 group tables and 3 two-person tables. We actually ended\u00a0up ordering first because there were no group tables when we first came in. But we waited 5-10 minutes, a table eventually opened up and we sat down.", "Monarca is a little mom & pop restaurant in a tiny shopping center. It may seem a little sketchy from the looks of it, but the food did not disappoint. Came here for dinner with a party of 4. The seating is tight, but it works. I would honestly call it a fusion restaurant as there are Italian, American, and Mexican cuisine options. There is also a parking lot. It is a little small but we were able to find street parking. ", "Monarca is a small restaurant located in a similarly small strip mall about a mile from USC. What I really appreciate about this place is that it is not in a pretentious area but it still has extremely good food AND pricing. There is some parking in the strip mall, but it can get pretty tight (literally) and/or full. There's plenty of street parking across the street.

They better not change a thing or go no where this is my new addiction even though I need to lay off the carbs i don't care this food is delicious in my budget and it's a great portion I had the lobster ravioli can't wait to try the seafood pasta next", "This place is one of those hole in the wall places that people don't really know about but they serve really good food. It's located near USC so students should definitely come here to check out the food because they serve a pretty big portion for a good price!", "My sister randomly found this place since she was looking for food near USC. It is a small restaurant in the same plaza as Olympian diner, and if you drive by, you most likely would not have noticed it. We wanted to come on a Tuesday, but apparently they're closed on Tuesdays.", "Hmmm really good for the price and quality, very generous amount yet satisfying. I will definitely go back to try the rest whenever im craving for italian food aka high carb food lol", "The only reason I went to this place was because my coworkers kept saying how good it was. I ordered the double chicken breast plate with rice beans and tortillas. I got my food and it was cold the tortillas were stale. I reheated them and it got worse. The chicken was overcooked it was rubbery. The rice was bland no flavor. I will never go back to this place again. I'm sorry but this is just my honest opinion of the dish I had. Never taken advice from my coworkers when it comes to food these savages will eat anything!!", "Garbage place !! \u00a0Who puts onions on Alfredo sauce ? Absolutely disgusting place everything tastes horrible here never coming back fake ass Italian wannabe place", "Wow just wow \u00a0I live about a mile away from this place I've been living in this area for 5 years now and this is my 1st time going there I order their lobster ravioli with cream sauce and when I tell you it's so feeling and flavorful and the price is great I will definitely be back", "Definitely a gem tucked away near USC! The restaurant doesn't look like much from the outside, but the food and service on the inside is amazing!", "Where do I start!!! Thank you Yelper's because this place is amazing!!! Both my husband and I had very delicious meals. The seafood pasta and the Shrimp Beotchetas was amazing. The prices are extremely cheap and affordable. I wished I lived closer I would go every week.", "Very good pizza and at such a good price. This place is at a little shopping strip and doesn't look like much but the reviews were right. I haven't tried other options but definitely will be going back.", "Definitely give this place a try you won't be sorry !!! Chicken burrito and Carne asada plate do not disappoint! Coming back for sure. The service was good and the food is packed with flavor. They make the most simplest chicken burrito taste so good !", "DELICIOUS! This place is absolutely amazing and the service is even better. It's a small location but the food is beyond tasty. The prices are extremely reasonable especially because they serve generous amounts. We always get their chicken and vegetable pizza when we have guests over because \u00a0it's different and delicious. 110% recommend this place!", "Large portions, unbelievably affordable. You wouldn't expect a good pasta restaurant to come from this plaza, but here it is. You can sit down and they'll bring a menu to you, or you can order at the counter. I noticed a lot of people saying they liked the Apple pie, but I tried it once and wasn't a fan - it didn't taste like much. My go to is the seafood pasta with pink sauce - packed with seafood, and the sauce is creamy and delicious!", "Best local Pasta Joint in the area!! Hidden gem by south central.
